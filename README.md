# dgl123-finalProject
The final project for this class has two options. You will complete EXACTLY ONE of the two options:
Option A: The objective for this project is to 1) reverse engineer (copy) the example webpage, and 2) using techniques covered in class, add features that you think would improve the page's appearance and functionality. Youâ€™ll need to inspect the HTML and static assets, copy what you need, and design a backend (php script) that behaves in the same way as the example. In this case, the backend data will be provided as a JSON file. Try to match both the functionality and the design of the example website as closely as possible. The example website is https://simpsons.img100.chrisgeelhoed.com/.

Option B: The objective of this project is to define and complete a scripting project that's of significant interest to you.  It can be a pet project you've always wanted to do but never had time for, a side business project, or a piece of functionality for a friend.  Your work MUST use the methods and techniques covered in this class and should NOT include other methods (that is, it should be a DGL 123 project).  The scale of the project should be similar to that defined in Option A above.  If you choose this option, you will need to obtain approval by submiting a project proposal including an interface mockup and a description of the methods you intend to use to accomplish the project. 

In both cases, you are expected to submit your project on Github, including a filled out grading rubric, and a one-page project summary detailing the goals of the project and the PHP features used in your project, including any difficulties encountered and how you addressed those issues.
The project will be marked roughly in accordance with the grading rubric (you are expected to submit one here), but with more of an emphasis on usability and thoughtful interface design choices and modes of user interaction, and comprehensive use of PHP features introduced this semester. The following questions may help focus your work:
- Is the operation of the site apparent to a user?
- Does it work properly? Does it have bugs? Are there dead-end pathways through your interface? Does it work on a computer other than your own?
- Did you use concepts like conditionals, loops, arrays, and functions to make your code concise, or is your code unnecessarily repetitive?
- Did you include features like file and database interaction or the storage of session cookies?
- Is your code readable to others? Are your variable names sensible?
- Does your project match the look and behavior of the example website?
